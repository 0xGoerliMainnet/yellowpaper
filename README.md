# SatoshiVM: Advancing On-Chain Verification for Bitcoin and Enhancing Layer-2 Implementation

Welcome to the repository for SatoshiVM YellowPaper â€“ a groundbreaking blockchain designed to elevate the verification capabilities of arbitrary functions on Bitcoin, with a specific focus on enhancing Layer-2 (L2) block verification.

## Abstract

This paper introduces an innovative approach to validate the precise execution of arbitrary functions on Bitcoin, aiming to fortify Layer-2 block verification. SatoshiVM is meticulously crafted to ensure the accurate execution of L2 blocks on Bitcoin, all while seamlessly integrating with the existing infrastructure and without requiring modifications to the underlying Bitcoin protocol.

## Key Features

- **Secure Settlement Layer:** SatoshiVM positions Bitcoin as a secure settlement layer for L2 transactions, reinforcing the security of Bitcoin L2 transactions.

- **Taproot Integration:** Leveraging the features of Taproot, SatoshiVM enables the representation of complex function executions through a single hash.

- **Off-Chain Zero-Knowledge Proof:** Conducting the entire zero-knowledge proof process off-chain for each block enhances the efficiency and integrity of the verification process.

- **Data Availability Verification:** During block validation, the L2 block miner transmits block data and proof data hash to Bitcoin, facilitating third-party verification through a specific Data Availability layer.

- **Sequencer Transaction Reordering Prevention:** The integration of SVMZK within SatoshiVM prevents transaction reordering by the sequencer, bolstering the robustness of the blockchain.
